Onosendai - A better deck
=========================

A multi-column Twitter client with a focus on list support.

Features
--------

* Background tweet fetching (currently fixed 15 min interval).
* Home timeline, mentions, personal timeline, and lists can all be columns.
* Read Later column: any tweet can be saved locally for reading later.
* Configured via JSON file on the file system.
* Currently can only read, not write (its a work in progress).

Supported Services
------------------

Currently only Twitter columns are supported.
SuccessWhale intergration is in progress but currently incomplete.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration is stored in `deck.conf` file that lives in the root
of the external storage device, typically `/sdcard/deck.conf`.
If this file does not exist it will created when the UI is launched.
